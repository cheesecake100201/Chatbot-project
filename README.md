Chatbot-project: This chatbot project is a basic project which has a sign up and a login page. Login is done using django authentication. For authentication purposes, the information of the user is stored in sqlite3 database. And the database created is stored in mongodb. The responses of bot in this chatbot are not on a trained method. Some responses are hardcoded and they are randomly assigned to a query using random module in python. We can use the openAI module as well. Later this chatbot app has been dockerized.
